This project was done using the web reference http://asiri.rathnayake.org/articles/hacking-josh-operating-system-tutorial/.

The added functionalities included to the operating system are,
  1)Implement a new command for your operating system which prints hardware information about the computer.
  2)Modify JOSH so that it natively boots from a FAT32 USB device.
